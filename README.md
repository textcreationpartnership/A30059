The Contrariety of POPERY TO THE Bleſſed Word of GOD; Wherein may be ſeen that the DOCTRINE and PRAC
#####Body#####

1. I. The Fundamental Doctrine of the Romiſh Church, That the bleſſed Apoſtle St. Peter was the Head and Governour of all the Apoſtles and of all the Church, is not conſiſtent with the ſacred Scriptures but is flat contrary to them.

1. II. Their Poſition and Doctrine, That the Biſhops of Rome do ſucceed St. Peter in ſuch a Supreme Power and Authority, and are now the Head of all the Chriſtian Church, is not conſiſtent with the ſacred Scriptures, but directly contrary to them.

1. III. Their keeping the ſacred Scriptures in a Tongue unknown to the common People, and not ſuffering them to come to the knowledge of them, that they may read them and practiſe the things therein commanded; And inſtead of them, impoſing their own Commands and a blind Belief upon their Proſelytes and Lay-Members, is flat contrary to the Word of God, and a very wicked thing.

1. IV. Their performing their Worſhip and Divine Service in an unknown Tongue which the common People do not underſtand, is not agreeable to the ſacred Scriptures.

1. V. Their worſhipping of Images is directly contrary to the ſacred Scriptures.

1. VI. Their worſhipping of the Saints and Angels is not agreeable to the bleſſed Word of God.

1. VII. Their Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation [that is, That the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, after Conſecration, are changed into the real Body and Blood of Chriſt our Saviour] is not agreeable to the bleſſed Word of God.

1. VIII. Their worſhipping of the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is contrary to the Word of God, and groſs Idolatry.

1. IX. Their pretending to ſacrifice and offer up Chriſt to God the Father for the Quick and Dead, is not agreeable to the ſacred Word of God.

1. X. Their keeping the Cup in the Sacrament from the Lay-people is not agreeable to the ſacred Scriptures.

1. XI. The Practice of the Romiſh Church in reſpect of Marriages is not agreeable to the Word of God.

1. XII. Their Doctrine of Purgatory, and their Maſſes and Prayers and Abſolutions for the delivering of men from thence, are not agreeable to the ſacred Scriptures.

1. XIII. Their ſelling of Pardons and Indulgences for Money is not agreeable to the bleſſed Word of God.

1. XIV. The Practice of the Romiſh Church in depoſing and dethroning of Emperors Kings and Princes, and turning them out of their Empires Kingdoms and Dominions; and abſolving their Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance, and from all Fidelity and Obedience to them, is directly contrary to the Word of God.

1. XV. Their debaſing and vilifying of the bleſſed Word of God as obſcure and dangerous and inſufficient, and productive of Errors and Hereſies: And their making their oral Traditions of as great Authority as the Word of God, and letting them take place of it, is ſinful enough, and inconſiſtent with the ſacred Scriptures.

1. XVI. Laſtly, the bloody Cruelty of the Romiſh Church is not at all conſiſtent with the Goſpel of Chriſt.
